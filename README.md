I had issues with correctly invoking my functions. I was logging "Please add pepperoni and sausage" twice when I only needed it once, and I was showing an "undefined" in the console. I was able to fix my invoking errors by removing some unnecessary console.log's. 

I used W3schools to figure out how to correctly write a method within my object variable and with some function invoking.
